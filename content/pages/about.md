date: 10-13-2022

I am enthusiatic about python, data science, and art. I have a  Phd in mathematics from the University of Illinois at Chicago. I really enjoy constructing demonstrations of techniques from data science, constructing visualizations, and turning them into art. 
I enjoy writing informational articles about statistics and textile art. 
I've written an undergraduate text book on virtual knot theory, [An invitation to knot theory](https://www.amazon.com/Invitation-Knot-Theory-Virtual-Classical/dp/1498701647/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2OGKI08GT6RNB&keywords=heather+dye+book&qid=1666377091&sprefix=heather+dye+book%2Caps%2C88&sr=8-1).  I enjoy all forms of textile art in my free time.
