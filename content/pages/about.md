date: 10-13-2022



I am enthusiatic about python, data science, and art.  I  enjoy constructing demonstrations of techniques from data science and turning them into data visualizations and art. 

I enjoy writing informational articles about statistics and textile art. If you are interested in my textile art, check out my website at 
[Heather Ann Dye](https://heatheranndye.com). 

I  have a  Phd in mathematics from the [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://www.uic.edu/). I was a mathematics professor at the United States Military Academy and McKendree University. During that time, I wrote articles on knot theory and an undergraduate text book on virtual knot theory, [An invitation to knot theory](https://www.amazon.com/Invitation-Knot-Theory-Virtual-Classical/dp/1498701647/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2OGKI08GT6RNB&keywords=heather+dye+book&qid=1666377091&sprefix=heather+dye+book%2Caps%2C88&sr=8-1). 

I taught statistics, data science, and actuarial science. I've decided to make the leap into industry so that I can pursue my interest in state of the art machine learning. 



I enjoy all forms of textile art in my free time.
